# ICP-MS-AUTOMATION

This code automates ICP-QMS and ICP-QQQ-MS instruments for high-temporal-resolution river water monitoring using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The Python script provides full automation of:
- Software login and plasma ignition
- Warm-up delays
- Batch creation and tuning
- Measurement execution
- Error monitoring with email alerts
- Automatic shutdown of the ICP-MS system after measurements

The code can be scheduled using Windows Task Scheduler for automated operation.  
For setup and usage, please refer to the included user manual.
